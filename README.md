# Particle-Cleanup
A Garry's Mod addon that allows you to cleanup particles.

Welcome to Particle Cleanup!

Tired of all the particles blocking your view? Some troll spawned in and exploded a nuke and now your view is filled with all those huge particles? Well with this addon, those issues are no more. This addon simply gives the ability to cleanup particles, just like how you could do with any other entity.

Please note that this won't work for User > Cleanup > Particles in Utilities section of the spawnmenu. This is because User cleanups only cleanup entities spawned by the client, and particles are not entities.
